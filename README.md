## Teaching and Learning (TLS) Service at McGill University
- Project for INSY442 - Data Analysis and Visualization

# Introduction and Business Case
This project aims to analyze the distribution and accessibility of renovated classrooms at McGill University to determine whether they are allocated equitably across faculties. The primary stakeholders are McGill undergraduate students from diverse academic disciplines, all sharing an interest in ensuring fairness in their educational environments.

The analysis utilizes classroom data from McGill's Teaching and Learning Services (TLS), an organization committed to enhancing the educational experience through initiatives like classroom renovations and reconfigurations for active learning. By examining the allocation of modernized learning spaces, this project evaluates whether undergraduate students, regardless of faculty or field of study, have consistent access to these improved resources.

# Insights:
  Distribution: Faculties like Science and Arts have more classrooms, but renovation rates are uneven.

  Inequity: Students in Education have a 34% chance of using renovated classrooms, while Desautels students have only 10%.

  Renovation Trends: Traditional lecture rooms and auditoriums are more frequently renovated; active learning spaces receive less focus.

  Incidents: High incident rates donâ€™t always correlate with renovation priorities, indicating potential gaps in resource allocation.

  Challenges: Incomplete datasets and manual adjustments required due to locked Power Query settings.
